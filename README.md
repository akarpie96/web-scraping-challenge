# Web Scraping Nasa Information: 

The objective is to scrape data from NASA Mars Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Space-Facts, and Astrogeology.gov


* I will be using flask to route python app that scrapes the above websites for Mars information.
* NASA Mars scraping points to the first headline and article snippet.
* JPL clicks into the featured image and grabs the URL
* Space Facts grab the relevant Mars facts on the website and leaves out Earth Facts
* Astrogeology website grabs the clicks through the 4 different hemisphere of Mars and stores the URL of the images to be displayed.
